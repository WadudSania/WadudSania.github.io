abstract = {This paper analyses interdependence between the returns of specific energy and non-energy commodities and equities using (i) Thick Pen Measure of Association (TPMA) and (ii) Multi-Thickness Thick Pen Measure of Association (MTTPMA). We capture time-varying co-movement and co-movement across different time scales to analyse the short-term and long-term features of the time series using stationary data. Energy index futures show an increase in co-movement with equities since the start of the financialisation period. There are asymmetric effects in cross-scale co-movement between various commodities and equities. Weak co-movement between equity and specific commodity futures indicates diversification benefits for short-term and long-term investors.}
